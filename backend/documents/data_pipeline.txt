A data pipeline is a series of processes that move data from one system to another. 
It often includes data collection, cleaning, transformation, and loading into a storage or analysis system. 
Data pipelines are essential in machine learning as they prepare data for training and evaluation. 
Tools like Apache Airflow and AWS Data Pipeline are commonly used to automate and manage data pipelines.
